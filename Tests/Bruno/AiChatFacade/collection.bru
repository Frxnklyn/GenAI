  To use this collection, the target environment must have a user with the rights to use the AiChatFacade (a SUPERUSER will do too) with a special API key.
  
  1. Go to Administration > Users & Security
  2. Open the user you want to use
  3. Go to the tab "API Keys"
  4. Press "+ Add"
  5. Give the toke a name (like "Bruno API key for AiChatFacade") and the key value `BrunoApiAccessToken`. You can change the token value in the environment of Bruno if you like.
  
  Now the requests in this collection should work.
